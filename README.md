# clc_flagger_project

The aim of this project is to analyze the progressive delivery Kubernetes operator Flagger and its components. We will create a documentation of deployment steps using service mesh applications, like Istio and Linkerd, and ingress controller, like Contour and Gloo. 

We will highlight their properties, functionality, pro, cons, and their differences. 

Additionally, we will create a tutorial highlighting their usage.
